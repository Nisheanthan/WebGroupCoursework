                    is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of
                    the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global
                    governing body.
                    The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
                    except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion
                    is France,
                    which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.</div>

                    the world championship for men's national association football teams. 
                    It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. 
                    FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation. <br><br>
                    All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, 
                    which was built for the tournament. 
                    In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2.</div>

                    <div class="prtB_items_text">From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. 
                    It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, 
                    but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. <br>
                    In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. 
                    However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.
                    The current trophy has been presented since 1974 After 1970,
                    a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed.</div>
