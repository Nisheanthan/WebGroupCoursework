                                    co-founded by the Belgian team's supervising body, the Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA).

                                    from 1982 to 2002 and again from 2014 onwards, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds. 
                                    Most of Belgium's home matches are played at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.</div>
