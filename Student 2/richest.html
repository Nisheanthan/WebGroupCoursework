                        Football Money League, charting the massive revenues of Europe's biggest football clubs.
                        The English Premier League dominates Deloitte's ranking with 10 clubs in the top 20 list, 
                        the most from one single league since records began.The financial power of English clubs was 
                        largely thanks to Premier League contracts worth in excess of £8 billion over three years.</div>

                                based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, 
                                the top flight of English football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club 
                                was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, 
                                changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, 
                                Old Trafford, in 1910.</div>

                            <div class="prtB_items_text">Founded on 6 March 1902 as the Madrid Football Club, 
                                the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. 
                                The word real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by 
                                King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. 
                                The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium 
                                in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, 
                                Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.</div>

                            <div class="prtB_items_text">Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and 
                                Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of 
                                Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). 
                                Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. 
                                It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, 
                                and the world's second-richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual 
                                turnover of €690.4 million.The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", 
                                written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.</div>
